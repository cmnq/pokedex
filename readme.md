# Pokedex

Simple Pokedex made in pure JS without any frameworks. API Calls based on [POKEAPI](https://pokeapi.co). This app is task i did for recruitment purposes. 

## Live version

If you want to test this Pokedex on any device, check [Demo version](https://cmnq.github.io/pokedex)

### Packages

```
node-sass
autoprefixer
concat
postcss-cli
npm-run-all
```

I wanted to re-create oldschool looking design to follow-up classic pokemon popular from the gameboy version. In order not to get lost in individual stages i used:
[.scss](https://sass-lang.com/) to have everything separated.
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make sure that everyone can enjoy discovering Pokemons.
[postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) & [concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concat) to merge everything.




### Installing

If you want to try Pokedex on your IDE, the easiest way is to get package.json file and hit

Say what the step will be

```
npm install
```

If you want to run app on your local server you need to run

```
npm start
```

If you made any changes, don't forget to rebuild css

```
npm run build:css
```


## Problems I have faced

* Working with popular and compound API
* A lot of requests
* Trying to separate type buttons from pokemon generations controllers
* Follow-up to classic Pokemons from GameBoy

## About testing...

I don't have knowledge about unit testing yet. But chill, im on a good way to learn from masters, huh? ;)


## Conclusion
I know this is not the most perfect version of pokedex.

On every problem I tried to find solution on my own way and solve the problem, and I know that in this app you could do something better - I'm not outstanding yet, but someday I will!
Unfortunately, I also know that overall site performance is not the best.

p.s
Gotta catchem all!
